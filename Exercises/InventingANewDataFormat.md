INVENTING A NEW DATA FORMAT
====

As a group, your task is to consider some of the challenges posed in the readings for designers working with data and come up with a proposed new data format that addresses one or more of them.

Some of the challenges data formats have might include...  
* Materiality of data (connecting it to bodies, means of gathering, and physical locations)  
* What is **not** included in the dataset? What is left out?  
* Ways that data could be less open to interpretation, more specific or clear  

And the "Seven Principles" outlined in the ACM document:  
* Awareness  
* Access and redress  
* Accountability  
* Explanation  
* Data provenance  
* Auditability  
* Validation and testing  

Discuss which of these challenge(s) your group wants to try to tackle. Together, design a hypothetical data format that attempts to address it. Your format can be based on an existing one (csv, json, xml, etc) or be one of your own invention.

Your goal in the next hour to to create single image or example file that illustrates your proposed format to present to the class.
