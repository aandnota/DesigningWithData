# DESIGN SPRINT  

Today we'll be running a "design sprint" (or part of one, at least) as a way of generating ideas for your final project. This process, developed at Google for their Google Venture incubator, is about opening a group's mind to new ideas, then coming up with solutions. Design sprints are also about making "evidence based" choices – using observations and testing to determine the best design decisions. While usually run with groups of designers and developers, we'll use the design sprint in class as another tool for design ideation.


## 0. DEFINE THE PROBLEM  
The first step happens before the sprint and outlines a "challenge statement." In this case, your initial brief accomplishes this task!


## 1. UNDERSTAND (THE CHALLENGE)  
The first step, before thinking about solutions, is to understand the challenge. On your own, quickly and without worrying about how this will be actually implemented later, think about these questions:

* What is foundational to this project? What absolutely must be accomplished?  
* What is useful and delightful to the viewer?  
* Think of stories related to the project? What experiences have you had, or would like to have?  
* Come up with "how might we...?" questions.  

Write down as much of this as you can. We'll then take some time for you to synthesize this with your brief, then present your project ideas to your group for some initial feedback.


## 2. DEFINE (A STRATEGY TO PURSUE)  
With a sense of the challenge, we can now start to think about strategies to pursue. These aren't quite solutions, but more like a set of ideas that define your project further.

**DECISION SLIDERS**  
Individually, write a list of 4–5 opposites that define choices for your project. 

These could be things like:  
* Design-related like **Geometric vs Organic** or **Simple vs Complex**  
* Style like **Tons of Stats vs Single Values** or **Bright Colors vs Muted/Dark**  
* Format/media like **Illustration vs Graphic** or **Printed vs Animation**  

When you have your words, draw them as sliders like this:  

        Geometric --------------|-------------- Organic
    Bright Colors --------------|-------------- Muted/Dark

As a group, you'll place dots along the sliders of your fellow group-mates as a way of "voting" on where you image each project fitting in this context.  


## 3. DIVERGE  
Normally, the work we've done so far would be done as a group and, at this point, we'd split into smaller groups or work individually. But we can still use the exercises of a sprint to further come up with ideas for your project.

**CRAZY EIGHTS**  
For this exercise, fold a piece of paper into eight equal sections. In five minutes, quickly sketch out 6–8 ideas that might apply to the project. These can be big, small, visual, technical, etc – anything goes. Try to make your sketches legible and add labels if necessary, but don't worry about great ideas at this stage; this is just about getting stuff out of your head and on paper. After sketching, we'll do silent dot-voting as a group – everyone gets 3 dots each, so use them wisely! 

For the second round, divide your paper into eight sections again. In each of the squares, take on different point-of-view to approach the project from. 

These include:  

* Pessimist  
* Optimist  
* Advocate  
* Novice audience  
* Expert audience  
* Idea generator  
* (Bonus: a role not listed above!)  
* (Bonus: a role not listed above!)  

After both rounds, start working on some paper prototypes.


## 4. DECIDE and 5. PROTOTYPE  
The next steps, which we'll start in class and continue for your homework, is to decide on a way forward and start working on prototypes (aka work in progress). The goal here is to be just good enough to get the idea started, but not about perfection.

Take another sheet of paper and fold it in half in the "hamburger" direction. Using some of your ideas from the previous steps, draw two more detailed versions that expand those ideas – things that were promising but need to be expanded on, things that could be combined, or things that are terrible and need revision. This doesn't need to be fancy but is about the hardest part: where to go after an initial idea.


## 6. VALIDATE  
Our final step is to test with real users, in this case your fellow students. Next week, you'll get feedback from everyone on your work in progress, helping you improve your project and think about next steps.
