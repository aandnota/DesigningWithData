# FEMINIST DATA VIS JAM

In her post [*What Would Feminist Data Visualization Look Like?*](https://civic.mit.edu/2015/12/01/feminist-data-visualization), [Catherine D'Ignazio](http://www.kanarinka.com) of MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning talks about the fallacy of that data is capable of capturing everything and that data visualization will be able to show a neutral point of view.

Today, we'll unpack D'Ignazio's post and explore her prompts, not from the standpoint of creating visualizations but instead thinking about systems of power and how visualization might address or make them visible.


## HOW IS THIS FEMINIST? WHAT ABOUT OTHER GROUPS?  

"Feminist" data vis isn't just concerned with women; as D'Ignazio puts it "feminist standpoint theory would say that the issue is that all knowledge is socially situated and that the perspectives of oppressed groups including women, minorities and others are systematically excluded from 'general' knowledge." In [another post](http://www.kanarinka.com/project/data-feminism/), she points to data science as a form of power, both for good and bad, and that data visualization is a part of that power structure and should be explored and critiqued. 

This larger view of feminism, coined ["intersectional feminism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) by [Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Williams_Crenshaw) in 1989, means we can view inequality as overlapping systems of opression and discrimination due to ethnicity, sexuality, and economic background. 

In our exercise today, I encourage you to think about the myriad ways that people are marginalized, oppressed, invisible, or simply have different experiences.


## YOUR TASK  
In D'Ignazio's original post, she posits three prompts for data visualizers:

1. Invent new ways to represent uncertainty, outsides, missing data, and flawed methods  
2. Invent new ways to reference the material economy behind the data  
3. Make dissent possible  

The task for your group is to consider one of these prompts (or a small part of one) and propose something that addresses or makes it visible.

This might take the form of:  
* Methodology: how data gets collected, stored, or parsed  
* Format: a way of displaying data  
* Project: ideas for a data visualization project  
* Dataset: data that doesn't exist yet or has major gaps  
* Best practices: recommendations for visualizers  
* ???: some other form or approach not listed above  

This process is meant to be open-ended and exploratory; simple ideas can cumulatively make a big difference. Think about the projects we did this semester, D'Ignazio's post and Andy Kirk's talk, and perhaps most importantly your own personal experience.

We'll spend some time ideating, then do quick pitches to the class. After that, your group will refine its idea and create a prototype that can be shown at the end of the day.


## FURTHER IDEAS TO CONSIDER  
D'Ignazio also further refines these in her book to [seven principles for data feminism](https://civic.mit.edu/2019/09/26/liveblog-catherine-dignazio-data-feminism), which may also be helpful for your group to consider:  

1. Examing power  
2. Challenge power  
3. Elevate emotion and embodiment  
4. Rethink binaries and hierarchies  
5. Embrace pluralism  
6. Consider context  
7. Make labor visible  

I would also add:  

* Strengthen communities ("Without community, there is no liberation... but community must not mean a shedding of our differences, nor the pathetic pretense that these differences do not exist." — Audre Lorde)  
* "Build with, not for" ([Laurenellen McCann](https://www.buildwith.org/work))
