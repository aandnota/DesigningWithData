DRAWING DATA
====

### DUE: WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 24  

Soon we'll be thinking about scientific and social data, and learn to use computers for parsing large datasets and making complex visualizations. But for our first assignment, we'll start a little more simple: this week, your assignment is to collect data about your daily life and find a way of displaying that information visually.

**DATA**  
Think about what data you can capture – things that describe the mundane, personal, and usual activities that make up your day. (We'll do an ideation session together in class to get this process started.) It may be helpful to record a few different things, to be sure you get something interesting.

Once you've decided what to record, think about how:

* Where should you record your data? Your phone in a note file? Notebook? Scrap of paper in your pocket? Camera?  
* What kind of information does your data require you capture? Do you need special notation?  
* What time range should you record? (You'll want a lot of data to show – more is better!)  

**VISUALIZATION**  
With your data recorded (or even while it's being captured), consider how you'll display it. Your visualization doesn't need to be useful or even easy to read, but consider what design elements (shape, size, color, composition, etc) you can use and how they communicate something about your data. Feel free to use standard visualization formats like line or pie charts, but you are encouraged to create your own notation too!

### DELIVERABLES  
Your finished project should include the following:

* Finished drawing, at least 8.5x11", with a legend showing how to read your visualization  
* Please include your name, either on the front (in a way that fits with the drawing) or on the back  

Remember that craft counts! Your drawings should be clean, free of wrinkles or creases, and look finished. Take time and care in your work. Bring your finished drawing to class – we'll have a short critique of everyone's projects.

**If you're not an art major, please be check if you have access to Adobe Illustrator using the [VLE](http://www.stevens.edu/vle)! You can also purchase access to [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html), if you prefer. If you are a major and haven't installed the Adobe software, please see me after class.** 

### PROJECTS SHOWN  
* Nicholas Felton's wonderfully-design and -printed [*Annual Reports*](http://feltron.com/index.html), capturing a range of personal data throughout the year (facilitated, in part, by a custom iOS app he built)  
* Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec's amazing [*Dear Data* project](http://www.dear-data.com/all/). Georgia and Stefanie recorded data of their daily lives each week for a year, then sent hand-drawn visualizations to each other as postcards  
* The [*Bicycle Seismograph*](http://katihyyppa.com/bicycle-seismographs), a more mechanical approach developed by Kati Hyyppä  
* George Perec's [*Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Attempt_at_Exhausting_a_Place_in_Paris) (an excerpt is in the `Readings` folder)
