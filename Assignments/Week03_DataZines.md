# DATA ZINES

**DUE MONDAY, OCT 21**  

Having now made some experimental visualizations exploring personal and numerical data, we're going to work on a larger-scale project that takes on a complex topic through a series of visualizations in the form of a zine.*

Instead of starting with a dataset, we'll start with the question: "what do I wish I knew?" This is a really generative way of working that doesn't assume prior expertise; instead, you start the project with something you really want to know more about.

>"My expertise has always been my ignorance, my admission and acceptance of not knowing... When you can admit that you don't know, you are more likely to ask questions that will enable you to learn." — Richard Saul Wurman (architect, designer, and founder of TED conference)

Your topic should be either an historical event or a social issue. This will help keep your project grounded and will make your findings relevant to other people. (However, I'm wide open to how you interpret that, so please feel free to pitch weird takes on what an historical event or social issue might be!) You'll research your topic, find related data, develop a story you want to tell, design visualizations, and finally print and bind your zines in a small edition that can be shared with the class.

\* What is a ["zine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine)? Zines are self-published, short-run publications. They often combine text and image, and were traditionally printed with photocopiers rather than big printing presses, enabling them to be created by anyone and about any topic. Zines have a wonderful tradition in punk culture, but have also seen success in comics and other subcultures.

## DELIVERABLES  

* Project pitch with sample data (presented to the class)  
* Two data-points/datasets with info about each and how they relate to the "story" of your project  
* At least six visualizations telling a story or communicating a long-form idea about your topic  
* Zine mockups (printed)  
* Dataset published as a Google Doc (or elsewhere), with a link included in the final zine  
* Final printed and bound zines in an edition of ~17~ two

* Tues, Oct 15: printed mockup zines due  
* Mon, Oct 21: finished zines due


## FOR MONDAY, SEPT 23  

This week, your task is to think about what historical event or social issue you'd like your zine to be about and craft a "pitch" to the class. Start with the question "what do I wish I knew?" and use it to drive your initial research. Think of yourself as a data journalist (which is a real job!), considering not just a bunch of facts but how you can communicate a compelling story to us.

When ready, put together a short pitch presentation in no more than two slides. Try to address the fundamental journalistic principles:

* Lead: a 1-2 sentence summary of your topic  
* The basics of who, what, why, when, where, and how?  
* Angle: given your research, what is your particular point of view or way you plan to present this topic?  
* At least one datapoint you've found that feels relevant to your topic; this should be something exciting and that sums up your approach – no need to visualize this yet, just present it to us  

We will give these presentations to the class next week, with some feedback from the group.


## FOR MONDAY, SEPT 30  

This week, your next step is to take the feedback received on your pitch and start refining it into a "story" you want to tell through the data. 

Please create a Word file, Google Doc, or text file where you can dump everything you find – anything (*anything!*) that you come across should be put in this file, including URLs so you can find it again.

Research your topic further, with a focus on context that is directed towards the story you want to tell. In particular, start trying to collect data points or full datasets that you can work with. "Dataset" here can be in a traditional format, like the ones we looked at in class, but it could also be:  

* A single, useful number (ex: number of hotdogs Americans eat per year)  
* Stats you create from numbers you find (ex: what percentage of recommended annual sodium intake would that number of hotdogs equal?)  
* A list of things (ex: most common hotdog toppings around the world)  

For next week, please find at least two data-points or datasets you think will be useful. For each, write:

* A short summary of what the dataset shows  
* How it relates to your project's topic/story  
* An interesting or suprising thing you found in the data – this is key, since it's the start of how you'll think about visualizing the data  
* Optional: try a quick visualiztion of the data, either by hand or in Illustrator, and add it to your written summary  

**Please print your two summaries and bring them to class next week.**


## FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 15  
**Note! Jeff is out of town Oct 7 so we won't meet. Monday, Oct 14 is fall break and Tuesday is a Monday schedule, so we meet next on Oct 15!**  

For our next class meeting (see note above), please create a mockup of your zine's pages and print each page on a separate sheet of paper. Be sure to include a front and back cover design.

While the format of your zine is up to you and experimentation is definitely encouraged, the basic setup would be to print your zines on `8.5 x 11"` paper, folded in half. You can create an artboard the size of each page in Illustrator:

<p align="center"><img alt="Screenshot of artboard setup in Illustrator" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffThompson/DataVisualization/master/Images/Week03-DataZines/IllustratorScreenshots/PageLayout.png"></p>

Then make multiple artboards my typing `Shift + O` to open the artboard editor, then click the little page button to make more artboards:

A few more details to consider:  
* The laserprinter can't print right up to the edge of the paper ("full bleed"), so if you want things printed right up to the edge, give yourself a 1/4" margin and plan to trim your finished booklet with the guillotine.  
* A full-page spread, where things go across two pages seamlessly, is really tricky with a normal printer like ours – you can try it, but it might not work well.  
* Remember! If you want to fold your pages, you'll need to have the total number of pages be a multiple of four (since we print two pages per side x two sides per page).

Focus on the visual style and focus on the story you want to tell through your data. You have two weeks to work on this, so your mockups can be work-in-progress but should be pretty close to how you want your final version to look.
