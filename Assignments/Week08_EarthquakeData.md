# EARTHQUAKE DATA

**DUE MONDAY, NOV 4**  

So for, we've worked with data manually, digging and creating visualizations in Illustrator. But that has a lot of limitations: we can't quickly change parameters of our visualization and definitely can't work with massive datasets. For the rest of the semester, we'll turn to code as a tool to create visualizations, allowing us both a more powerful tool and one that lets us start to explore data as a *medium* for art-making, not just something to be parsed and explained.

As our first step into code, we'll create visualizations of US Geological Survey earthquake data. Our tool will be Processing, a programming environment created for artists and designers.

Your assignment is to load the USGS data (and a map, if you want to include it) and create some kind of visual from the data. Don't worry about this being a useful visualization – instead, it can just be an intersting visual created *from* the data.


## DELIVERABLES  

* Sketch (in code) exploring the data  
* Finished visualization, exported as a `PNG` file named `LastnameFirstname_Earthquakes.png` and uploaded to Canvas  


## FOR MONDAY, OCT 29  

For next week, please continue to experiment with the code we started in class. Processing programs are called "sketches" and you should think about this week as that: sketching in code to explore ideas. If you feel comfortable with programming, try to apply what you know. If code is new to you, no worry: you can do a lot by varying the kinds of shapes being drawn, colors, etc. 

Start with the `EarthquakeTemplate` in the `Demos` folder. Try changing the parameters in the sample code and see what you like. The goal is to start getting familiar with Processing and to explore visual possibilities. Bring your code sketch to class next week – we'll look at them together and do some more demos.


## FOR MONDAY, NOV 4  

For next week, please continue refining your visualization in Processing. Remember, the goal isn't necessarily to make a "useful" visualization that tells us something about the earthquakes, but uses the data as a source to create visuals. This means your sketch can overlay the data on the map, but it can also be an abstract image created from the data. When finished, be sure to add the `save()` command to export your image as a `PNG` file, rename it `LastnameFirstname_Earthquakes.png` and upload it to Canvas.
