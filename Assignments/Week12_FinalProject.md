FINAL PROJECT
====

### DUE: TUESDAY, MAY 15

For our last project of the semester, you'll work on a large-scale visualization project on a topic of your choosing. The goal will be to start with something you're passionate about, conduct research and identify useful data, collect and/or create datasets, explore that data to find stories to tell, and create a finished project that presents that data in a visual way.

The final output format is up to you: it might be a single infographic shown as a printed poster, a series of visualizations presented as an online story, a video or animation, a sonification and podcast, or some non-traditional media. However you choose to make your project, it should be ambitious and represent four weeks' work.

### PROJECT TIMELINE  

* **Wed, April 11:** Project assigned, ideation exercise, research and initial data gathering on Are.na  
* **Wed, April 18:** Project research feedback session, design sprint, data dig and work day  
* **Wed, April 25:** Small-group project presentations, demos as needed, work day  
* **Wed, May 2:** Work-in-progress critique, demos as needed, work day  
* **Fri, May 4:** Make-up snow day – no class, but I'll be available all day to help with projects, etc  
* **Tues, May 15:** Projects due! Critique together as a group, bye (note we'll meet in the Lab, not whatever location is listed online)  

### DELIVERABLES  
Your finished project should include the following:
 
* An Are.na channel of research clippings (annotated links, images, etc) with at least 30 sources, posted as a link on the assignment on Canvas  
* An `8.5x11"` version of your project's "question"  
* Small-group presentation of your project's topic and data  
* Finished visualization, with documentation uploaded to Canvas  

### FOR WED, APRIL 18  
Rather than start with a project proposal at this early stage, for this project we'll start with a topic and a ton of research. Think about a social issue, a geographic place, an historical event, a sport, a technical challenge, a TV show, or something else that you're super excited about and would want to spend the next month researching and thinking about. It should be something complex enough to gather data on, but if it's really, really huge you might also think about drilling down to a specific part.

Once you've got an idea what you'd like to work on, start your research. Initial sources like Wikipedia can be helfpul, especially if you follow lots of the links on the page. But also try looking more broadly for information and context. To take notes, we'll use the platform [Are.na](https://www.are.na), which is a sort of bookmarking, annotatation, and note-taking site. Please sign up (it's free), make a "channel" for the project, and add the things you find!

**Please try to get at least 30 sources this week – more is better! When you're done, post the URL to your channel as a comment in the assignment on Canvas.**

With all that in hand, formulate your topic into a "question" that you want to ask through the data. This can be open-ended and not have a clear answer, or suggest an obvious methodology, but will guide your data-gathering and next steps.

Some examples:

* "How healthy are Americans compared with 100 years ago?"  
* "What do we find when we correlate wages in different regions in the US?"  
* "How does healthy are different fruits and vegetables?"  
* "What was it like to be a pioneer on the Oregon Trail?"  

When you figure out your question, design a vertically-oriented `8.5x11"` page using only typography to pose your question. Any font/layout is fine. Print your page on the laser printer and bring it to class next week.

### FOR WED, APRIL 25  
During the next week, please continue looking for data that you can use, and start digging through it for useful parts. Consider the research and ideation exercises we did in class to help you find sources/directions. If you need to hone your question to be more specific, or add context to it to be more broad, now's the time.

Please also prepare a very short presentation (2-3 mins) on your project topic and approach. This can be as a Powerpoint/Keynote or another format, but should be more polished that a casual "here's kind of what I'm thinking about" – pretend this is a pitch to a client.

Your presentation should address (at least):  

* What is your topic and the question you want to ask?  
* What are the data sets that you'd like to draw from?  
* What do you hope to show from the data?  
* What is at least one interesting thing you've found so far?  
* What format are you proposing for your visualization?  
* What is at least one question you want feedback on at this stage?  

You'll be presenting these to small groups of your peers for feedback during class next week.
