# FINAL PROJECT  

**CRITIQUE: MONDAY, DECEMBER 2  
DOCUMENTATION: DECEMBER 9 AT 9:00AM**  

As we approach the last four weeks of the semester, your final project is straightforward but wide open: to create something that visualizes data in some way. Think about the approaches we took this semester (hand-drawn/made, infographics, code-based) the kinds of data we worked with (daily life, numerical, researched, large-scale/scientific), and the tools we used (analog/physical, Illustrator, code). Like the zine project, your final project should address a topic that you're excited about and want to invest significant time and energy into, and use a medium you are interested in exploring more deeply. The approach, data source, and output format are up to you: infographics and charts are certainly an option, but so are zines, sculpture, video, performance, etc etc etc.

We'll start with an ideation session and a design brief for your project, followed by a few weeks of work and in-progress feedback. We'll have a final critique on the last day of class, with documentation of your project (and any final revisions) due during the exam period.


## DELIVERABLES  

* Project "brief" (printed single-sided and brought to class)  
* Work in progress check-ins (2x)  
* Final version ready for critique (last regular day of class)  
* Project documentation (turned in by the exam period to Canvas)  


## FOR MONDAY, NOVEMBER 11  

For next week, your first step will be to draft a "design brief" for your project. A brief is a document that outlines a project in detail. Usually created for a client), a brief includes a description of the project and a justification of your approach, but also may include user demographics, color schemes, and other research.

Your brief should include the following:  
* Project title  
* 1- or 2-sentence summary of your project (an abstract)  
* Description of your topic and your planned project format (2–3 paragraphs)  
* Preliminary list of data sources with 1–2 sentences of annotations each  
* What you'd like to know more about or a question you'd like to ask through your research (2–3 paragraphs)  
* Who you want this project to reach and why is this topic important to you and/or society? (1–2 paragraphs)  
* Any other materials you want to include: this might be inspiration images, sample visualizations of your data, annotated color schemes or font options, etc etc  

**Please print your briefs single-sided and bring to class. Remember that craft counts: design your brief carefully and make sure it's not crumpled in your bag. Pretend this is being presented to a client who is considering giving you this job.**
