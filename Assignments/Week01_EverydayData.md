# PERSONAL ACTIVITY

**DUE MONDAY, SEPT 9 (NO CLASS MONDAY, SEPT 2)**  

Soon we'll be thinking about scientific and social data, and learn to use computers for parsing large datasets and making complex visualizations. But for our first assignment, we'll start a little more simple: your assignment is to collect data about your daily life and find a way of displaying that information visually. You should visually record at least three different daily activities – mundane, personal, and usual activities you do like brushing your teeth. (We'll do an ideation session together in class to get this process started.)

Don't worry about numerical data or making charts (in fact, I *don't* want you to make a chart!) think about how you can keep track visually: evidence, marks, leftovers, etc. As an example, you could make a mark in toothpaste on a sheet of paper every time you brush your teeth, or you could keep every food wrapper for a week and arrange them in a line. Think creatively! How could you record every coffee you drink? Every step you take? Think too about timescale: should you record every meal you eat or every bite in a single meal?

Please also read *Interpreting Visualization, Visualizing Interpretation* from Johanna Drucker's 2014 book *Graphesis*, found in the `Readings` folder. Please write down one question that the reading raises that you'd like to discuss in class and one thing you were surprised or intrigued by. Post your response as a comment on this week's assignment. We'll do a critique of the project and discuss the reading in two weeks.
