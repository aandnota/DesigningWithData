INFOGRAPHICS: THE TITANIC
====

### DUE: WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 28  

So far this semester, we've looked at basic types of data and thought about strategies for displaying them. For the next project, we'll use those ideas to build a more complex narrative out of data, weaving together several bits of data into a cohesive presentation. This can take many forms, but when presented as a singular whole, we generally call this an "infographic". (Different from a single "visualization" in that it incorporates several datasets, and usually focuses more on storytelling with data than on analysis.)

We'll use as a source the story of the [Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic), a luxury ocean liner that famously sunk after hitting an iceberg. Your job is to create a poster that shows at least three datasets related to the Titanic, it's voyage, the sinking, and/or any subsequent history. You'll research the ship's history, find and parse data, create the infographic poster in Illustrator, and print it on our large-format inkjet printer.

All elements in your poster should be made by you: illustrations should be of your own making, and can take the place of any photographs you might want to use (though you can use them as source material).

### DELIVERABLES  
Your finished project should include the following:

* At least three datasets related to the Titanic  
* At least three sketches of your poster's layout, `8.5x11"` each or larger  
* Finished poster, designed in Illustrator  
  * `17x23"` image with a `1/2"` border all around (ie a total of `18x24"`)  
  * Printed on matte or luster paper  
  * Include a citation of your data in your poster's design  
* PDF of your poster uploaded to Canvas  

FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 14  
For next week, your task is to research and gather data. This is generally the first step in any data-vis project, but hopefully will be more fun that just looking at spreadsheets. 

Some areas you might look at are:  
* The building of the ship (what it contained, how much it cost compared to other ships, etc)  
* Who was on board (where they came from, how much they earned)  
* Icebergs (how they form, what they look like, relative sizes)  
* The sinking (order things happened, casualties and people rescued)  
* Things that happened after the sinking  
* Various efforts to recover and view the shipwreck  
* Etc etc etc â€“ dig through the story and find things you want to look at!  

Dig around and find aspects that interest you. Think about how you might weave that data into a narrative. You should also think about what presentation best tells your story: what typeface and colors you choose, etc.

With your research and design ideas in hand, please make at least three skeches of what your poster might look like. You can do these in Illustrator and print them, or draw them by hand. Think about the data and design questions above, plus how you will integrate your data visualizations into some kind of whole.

Finally, please also read [this essay by Jer Thorp](https://hackernoon.com/you-say-data-i-say-system-54e84aa7a421) on his project for the 9/11 Memorial, and data vis in general. It's a very nice take on working with complex data about people, and ties in nicely to the work we're doing. Please prepare at least one prompt or question for a discussion next week.

FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 28  
**Note! Wednesday the 21st is a Monday schedule, so we won't be meeting. Your assignment over the next two weeks is to finish this project.**

Details TBD, coming soon.

### RESOURCES  

* Lots of info (and probably a good data source) at the [Encyclopedia Titanica](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/)  
* A small, but [interesting selection of info from the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/titanic), including a [section on the iceberg](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/iceberg_sank_titanic)  
* A [video from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/video/movies/100000004393441/titanic-a-legend-born-in-belfast.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FTitanic) on the Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic  
* A [two-hour, real-time animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs9w5bgtJC8) showing the sinking  
* A nice piece in Smithsonian Magazine on [why we're still fascinated with the story of the Titanic](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-the-titanic-still-fascinates-us-98137822/) so many years later (and [another in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/16/unsinkable-3))  
* You could, of course, [watch the movie](https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/7108477/Titanic_(1997)_720p_HDTV_x264-_1.07GB_-YIFY) (no one will judge you... ok, maybe we will [a little](https://giphy.com/gifs/titanic-wine-76IGroXQrfTQk/fullscreen))
