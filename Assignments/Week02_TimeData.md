TIME DATA
====

### DUE: WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 31  

In our last assignment, you had a chance to think about data and ways to present it visually. For this project, we'll start using "real data" (ie numerical, stored in tables and data files), exploring how we can visualize data that changes over time. 

The most common way of showing time series data is a [line chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart). You've probably seen lots of these, showing things like stock prices or population change:

![Line chart showing world population from 1300–2000](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffThompson/DataVisualization/master/Images/Week02_TimeData/WorldPopulation_1300-2000.jpg)

This shows one thing very clearly: a steady rise in population from 1300 until about 1900, then an explosive growth into the year 2000. The scale we use changes how we see our data, but we can also recontextualize our numbers to tell a different story. Here's the same population data, but converted into the amount of time it takes for the world population to double:

There are a ton of other variations and additional elements that would tell us more about the data ([box plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot), [candlestick charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart), [violin plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot), [error bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_bar), etc), but for this week we'll keep things simple and focus on showing the change in one or two data streams over time.

Your assignment is to create a line chart in Adobe Illustrator of data related to the electricity consumption of communications technology like data centers, cellphone towers, and mobile devices themselves. Our dataset has been provided by Anders Andrae, a researcher at Huawei Technologies (thanks!). I've included a cleaned-up version with data I think will be most interesting, but you can also see Anders' original dataset, which has a **ton** of other data – you're welcome to dig into it. Both are in this week's `Data` folder.

**RESEARCH**  
Your first step will be looking through the data and getting some context to help you better understand it. You could read Anders Andrae's [original paper](http://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/6/1/117), though it may be a bit technical. You can also read about the impacts of technology on climate change (such as the electricity needed to [mine a single Bitcoin](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/27/bitcoin-mining-consumes-electricity-ireland)), or even just get a better sense of what a [terawatt-hour is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt_hour). The idea is not to become an expert, but to help you understand the data in order to make the best visualization possible.

**SELECT YOUR DATA**  
You don't have to show all the data given, and in fact it will probably be better to select just a few things. Think about what you find most interesting in the data, what elements or datapoints you might want to combine, etc. Later in the semester, we'll be calling this "storytelling" and talk about strategies for doing it better, but for now work with what's most interesting to you and experiment.

**VISUALIZATION**  
With your research done and data selected, think about how you'll present it. What shapes, colors, and overall visual style best presents the data? Do you want to show a change over time? What labeling does your visualization need? Presenting the data is your main task, but feel free to explore visually and try things out – no need to replicate boring Excel diagrams!

### DELIVERABLES  
Your finished project should include the following:

* Visualization of a selection of the data, including:  
  * At least one set of data from the file provided, showing a change over time  
  * Within the design of the visualization, include a citation of the data's source (which is listed in the data file)  
* Final version should be laser-printed on 8x5x11" paper, either at the Fab Lab or off-campus  

### RESOURCES  

* If you need help with Illustrator this week (or this semester), these [video tutorials from Adobe](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/tutorials.html) may be helpful  
* The [Graphic Design section of Stack Exchange](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/) may also be a good place to ask Illustrator questions    

### PROJECTS SHOWN  

* Some early visualizations:
  * Christiaan Hygens, showing life expectancy data from Graunt's life table (1669)  
  * Robert Plot's graph of barometric pressure in Oxford (1685)  
  * Nicolaas Kruik's diagram showing the distance of planets to Earth (1732)  
  * Joseph Priestley's chart of the lifespans of 2000 famous people from 1200BC–1750AD, and a similar chart of "revolutions of empire" (1765)
  * William Playfair created the first time-series line graph with labeled axes, grid lines, title, annotations, and color to indicate categories – here showing imports and exports to and from Denmark and Norway (1786)  
* Google NGram viewer, which lets you search for trends in word use over time  
* A parody line chart by William Addison Dwiggins, showing how breaking convention (and the visualization) can tell more than the data itself (1919)
