# TWO THINGS

**DUE MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 16**  

For our next project, we'll move on from merely gathering evidence of something to working with numerical data. But before we jump into spreadsheets and CSV files, for this assignment I'd like you to work with just two numbers comparing two different things. Your choice of topic is up to you, and part of your task will be to find your own data to work with!

Some ideas to get you started:  

* Relative size of two things (t-rex vs Empire State Building)  
* Two things that are related ([different breeds of dog, etc](https://modernpuppies.com/breedweightchart.aspx))  
* How many of one thing equals the other ([size of all the humans in the world compared to the Grand Canyon](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/humans-fit-into-grand-canyon_n_5255076))  
* Differences over time ([average wage for a woman in 1960 vs today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap_in_the_United_States))  
* Things that are surprisingly similar, things that are vastly different  

This marks the kind of research we'll be doing a lot this semester: exploratory searching, finding something interesting, and building a visual record of that information. Wikipedia is your friend here! Try searches for list pages (such as [Largest Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_organisms)). Take lots of notes in a text file, keeping careful track of the URL where you found your data. For anything outside of Wikipedia, try to find a second source to verify your numbers.

Once ready, create a visualization in Illustrator that shows the relationship between your datapoints. Think about what story you want to tell with your data (an important idea we'll return to over and over this semester) and use that story to help drive your design decisions. When done, save your file as a PDF and upload it to Canvas, and ~print a copy on the laser printer in the Fab Lab or Fed Ex~.

**Please note! The Fab Lab laser printer is broken â€“ a new one is on it's way but will not be here before the project is due. We'll look at everyone's work digitally instead, so no need to print anything.**


# DELIVERABLES  

* Two datapoints, with sources cited in your visualization  
* Visualization, sized `8.5x11 inches` with `1/2-inch` borders all around, created in Illustrator  
* File named `LastnameFirstname_TwoDataPoints.pdf`, saved as a PDF, and uploaded to Canvas by the start of class  
* ~Laser print of your visualization~ (we'll look at your work digitally)
