DATA DIG
====

### DUE: WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21  

> "Data in the 21st century is largely ephemeral, because it is so easily produced: a machine creates it, uses it for a few seconds and overwrites it as new data arrives. Some data is never examined at all, such as scientific experiments that collect so much raw data that scientists never look at most of it. Only a fraction ever gets stored on a medium such as a hard drive, tape or sheet of paper, yet even ephemeral data often has 'descendents'-new data based on the old. Think of data as oil and information as gasoline: a tanker of crude oil is not useful until it arrives, its cargo unladed and refined into gasoline that is distributed to service stations. Data is not information until it becomes available to potential consumers of that information. On the other hand, data, like crude oil, contains potential value." – Bohn and Short, *How Much Information?*

For this project, you'll be "digging" for data online in the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's](http://www.noaa.gov/) (NOAA, pronounced like *Noah*) server. The goal of this project is to dig up under-explored data from a massive pile – a lot like [dumpster diving](https://giphy.com/gifs/check-it-out-dr-steve-brule-xLsaBMK6Mg8DK/fullscreen) for data!

While sometimes visualizers are given nice, clean data, more often the first step is searching for something to work with. NOAA's mission is to assist in scientific research and monitoring of the oceans and atmosphere, including weather forecasting, climate data, and the impacts these things may have on commerce and travel. They operate remote sensing outposts, satellites, and even autonomous [data buoys](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) in the middle of the ocean!

Your assignment is to dig through the NOAA server, find data that is interesting to you, parse from it a story you want to tell, and create a visualization that shows us that story. The physical form of the project is completely up to you: a printed poster, a series of charts, a short play, sonification, sculpture, etc. Think about what presentation format best suits your data and what you want us to experience from it.

### ACCESSING THE NOAA SERVER  
To get access to the NOAA server, you'll need an File Transfer Protocop (FTP) client, a piece of software that lets your browse the server and download files. You can use Filezilla, which is free but a little clunky, or Transmit, which is $$ but works very well.

While most servers are locked with a password, NOAA data is created by the federal government for its citizens (you!) so it's publicly accessible. Here are the login details you'll need:

* Server: `ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov`  
* Username: `anonymous`  
* Password: none, leave blank!  

See the `Resources` folder for screenshots of where to put this info in Filezilla and Transmit.

Once logged in, you can navigate the directories and look inside. To download a file, navigate the left-hand side to your desktop or downloads folder. Right-click the file you want to save and click "download". (See the `Resources` folder for screenshots of this, too.) Be careful of file sizes, though! Data files can get *really* big.

### DELIVERABLES  
Your finished project should include the following:

* At least one dataset found on the NOAA server – **should be in CSV, TSV, JSON, or XML formats** (Find something else cool? Just ask if there's a way we can use it for this project and we'll talk)  
* A finished visualization, in any format (print, sound, sculpture, etc) that tells a story from your data  
* A citation of your data's source, either embedded in the piece or accompanying it

### FOR WEDNESDAY, MARCH 7  
For next week, please continue to dig for data like we did in class. Be sure to keep track of where you download your data from (a full path from the main page of the server, like a url) so you can cite it (and find it again) later.

Once you have data that interests you, start looking through it and think about what you want to show from the data. We'll look at how to view your data in Excel and do some basic operations on it.

### FOR WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21  
Finish your project, details TBD. (Note that March 14 is spring break, so no class!)

### RESOURCES
