### Refine visualization and finish project  
Your main task this week is to incorporate the feedback you got in class and refine your visualization. This version should be as carefully refined as you can using the tools we've covered so far. Think about what story your data tells and how best to show us it. If you need additional data or want to learn more about a feature of `chart.js` that will make your visualization better, go for it!

### Publish data as a Google Sheet  
When your visualization is done, the other main task this week is to publish your data online. It's very likely that you've modified the original data in some way: removing columns, renaming things in the header, or even merging multiple datasets. By publishing our data for everyone to see, we accomplish a few things: people can trace and audit our work, and they can use your data in their own projects (making your hard work pay off in a way that extends beyond your own visualization). 

📈 [See an example dataset with info tab here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kFYcBnjcvPd6R6EJ3te4vVXbzAAJHQUZbq2_0YPEVBY/edit?usp=sharing) 📉

As a platform, we'll use [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) – it's essentially the same as Excel, so it works great for `csv` data but makes sharing easy.

Add your data to the spreadsheet:  
1. Create a new spreadsheet  
2. Add your data...  
  * `File > Import → Upload...` and upload your CSV file (or copy/paste your data from Excel)  
  * Let Sheets automatically convert everything (unless you see it creates errors)  
3. Clean up formatting, such as:  
  * Font and font size  
  * Column layout (manual or right-click column → `Resize column → Fit to data`)  
  * Remove extra data or columns  
4. Rename spreadsheet to something clear  
5. Click the tab at the bottom (probably the filename you imported) and rename to something like `Data`  

Then create another tab in your spreadsheet:  
1. Call it `Info` or something similar  
2. Visualization info  
  * Title of the visualization you made with this data  
  * Your name  
  * Link to the project  
3. Sources    
  * Which dataset (if you have more than one)  
  * Author (person, organization, etc)  
  * URL to the data  
4. Column descriptions  
  * Explain what each column in the data is  
  * Might include an extra `Notes` section if there's more to add  
5. Any other info you want to include! More info and context is always great, letting folks dig in deeper if they want  

If you want to see some examples of how folks have published their own data, check out these examples:  

* [The Pudding](https://github.com/the-pudding/data)  
* [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/data/)  
* [Five Thirty-Eight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)  
* [*Reconstructing Early African American Film History Database*](https://github.com/miriamposner/af-am-film-data)  

(Note: most of these are hosted on Github, which is a lot harder to use than Google Sheets. If you'd prefer to use Github, go for it! Just make sure your repository is public.)

### Read *Continue, Pivot, or Put It Down*  
Please also read [*Continue, Pivot, or Put It Down*](https://pudding.cool/process/pivot-continue-down/) by The Pudding's Amber Thomas. It's a pretty quick read and talks about a really important idea in all creative projects but especially data visualization: how to know if an idea is a dead-end. (And it highlights some of the really cool projects The Pudding has done and ones that never made it to publication!)

### Turn everything in  
When finished, please submit two URLs to Canvas:  

* The link to your visualization code in the `p5.js` web editor  
* The link to your published dataset on Google Sheets
