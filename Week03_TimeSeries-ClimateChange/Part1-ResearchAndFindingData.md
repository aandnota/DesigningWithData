# PART 1: RESEARCH, FINDING DATA

### TLDR  
* ⚠️ Due Monday, March 1 by 11am EST ⚠️   
* [Create a folder with a notes file](#create-a-project-folder)  
* [Read `asdf`]()  
* [Find data to work with](#find-data-to-work-with)  
* [Submit annotated list of sources to Canvas](#turning-everything-in)  


To kick off the project, this week you should do three things:

### Create a project folder  
Organization is boring but so important for projects like these. You'll end up with tons of files, variations on your project, and lots of notes. Create a folder for your project and create a notes file inside. I really like `.txt` files for this because they load super quick, but you can use any format you want.

Keep careful track of *everything* you find! Inspiration images, graphics you find, screenshots, etc can go in a subfolder. Add URLs to where stuff came from in your notes file and annotate so you can quickly scan it later and find what you want!

My preferred structure:  

* Folder with project title  
* `_Notes.txt` file (the `_` at the start of the filename ensures it's at the top of the folder for easy access!)  
* `Images` folder (I use Apple's `Get Info > Comments` for storing image URLs)  
* `Data` folder (keep it all, you never know!)  
* Subfolders as the project progresses with clear file naming  

(Google Docs/Drive can be great but I find the login/search process to be way too slow and their permanence can be an issue for large projects. On the other hand, for collaborative projects a shared Dropbox folder works great and ensures everyone has access!)


### Read `asdf`  
Finding a single reading to introduce a topic as wide-randing as climate change is impossible. Instead, I've tried to pick something

Keep your notes file open while reading and add sources, thoughts, or areas you might want to research. The readings don't cover every possible take on the topic of climate change, so this is just a starting point.


### Find data to work with  
Most data vis projects start with finding data and this will be your main work this week. Sometimes this can be a hunt for elusive data buried deep on a website or even creating your own datasets when they don't yet exist! But data for climate change will be quite the opposite: a deluge of data to choose from.

Start by identifying the broad areas of climate change. These might include but are definitely not limited to:

* Historical temperature recordings  
* Change in average high temperatures  
* Record temperatures  
* Sea level rise  
* Ocean temperatures  
* Ice melt/glacial retreat
* Extreme weather events  
* Impact on poor and minority communities  
* Increased droughts, heat waves, and hurricanes  
* Causes of global warming (greenhouse gases, fossil fuels, deforestation, fertilizer use, etc)  

Pick one (or the intersection of more than one) that's interesting to you. You can use some of the sites listed in the `Data Sources` section in the main assignment or use the number one data visualization tool: Google! (Second would probably be Wikipedia.) Finding the right data can be time-consuming but you can also find interesting things you weren't looking for, so dig deep and wide.

A few requirements for your data:  
* Be time-based  
* In comma-separated values (`csv`) or spreadsheet format (`xlsx`, Google Sheets, etc) – other formats like `json` won't work for this project without complex conversion  

If your dataset is huge or has extra stuff you don't need, we can trim that later. When you find something interesting, be sure to add it to the notes file in your project folder.

When you've found at least one source you're excited about, write up 1–2 paragraphs that includes:  

* What does the data record?  
* Who created this dataset?  
* Who published it (if different than the creator of the data)?  
* URL to the data  
* Why this intrigues you  
* A guess as to what this data might show or stories you think it might tell when visualized (make an educated guess – it's ok if this turns out to be wrong!)  

(Aside: lots of times you'll find a site that you know has data but it is impossible to figure out how to access it! As an example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has a [data page](https://www.ipcc.ch/data) but the links to actual data are buried in tons of text. Sadly, this happens a lot. [The real data is here](http://www.ipcc-data.org) on a totally different site!)


### Turning everything in  
When you've found data you want to work with, paste your annotated list of sources into Canvas for this week.
