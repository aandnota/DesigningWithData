### Watch tutorials on loading data  
Just a few additional videos this week, mostly on `csv` data and how to load it into your sketch – see the list of new videos below:

* [Video tutorials for this week](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsGCUnpinsDn93L5F0BxBxILZoF5nyeLz):  
  * Comma-Separated Values (CSV)  
  * Loading CSV Files into chart.js  
  * Two Columns from CSV 
  * Merging CSV Files

### Clean up your data (if necessary)  
Data is rarely in the exact format we need and often contains gaps or othe problems. We'll look at ways of manipulating and working with your data throughout the semester, but for now just clean it up so that it can be loaded into `chart.js`. You can use Excel or Google Sheets for this.

Some things to consider:  
* Adding headers in the first row to label the data  
* Tidying up headers:  
  * No spaces between commas (ex: `year, maxTemp` &rarr; `year,maxTemp`)  
  * Remove spaces in header names (ex: `max temp` &rarr; `max_temp` or `maxTemp`, don't use dashes, periods, or other character that might interfere with your code!)  
* Removing columns of data that don't apply to your visualization or merging with another dataset  
* Cutting entries that you don't want to include (ex: date ranges that aren't important to the story you want to tell) or that are missing key data  

**But most important: save a copy!** You always want to preserve your original data. If I'm going to make changes, I like to duplicate my file first, that way I don't accidentally overwrite something important (ask me how I know).

If you're working in Excel/Google Sheets, export your data as a `csv` file so you can load it into your code.

### Create three variations on your visualization  
With your data ready, upload it to the `assets` folder in the [code template](). You should then be able to plug the data into `chart.js`.

Start in an exploratory way, seeing what the data looks like and thinking about what you want to highlight. This might mean going back to your file and editing things out (make another copy!). Explore color, formatting, interaction, labels... all the things that come together to tell a story through your data.

When you find something you like, duplicate your sketch and work on two more variations. This kind of exploration is really helpful to try things out and get useful feedback.

### Turning everything in  
With your design variations complete, take a screenshot of them – ideally, cropped just to the visualization. Upload them to Canvas. We'll take a look next time in small groups for feedback.


### Having trouble with your code?  
Code and data visualization can be confusing and frustrating at times, even if you've been doing this a long time! A few resources to look at:  

* Peer tutoring via VA&T Discord (email me for the invite link)  
* Email me for help or come to student and/or drop-in hours (day/times/links on Canvas)  
* Google search is such a key tool for this kind of work! Getting good at search terms and finding answers is invaluable  
* Work together! While we're not physically in the same place, meet up with friends over Zoom or Discord or whatever and help each other while you work
