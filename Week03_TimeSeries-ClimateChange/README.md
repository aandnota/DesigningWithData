  * Design variations  
* For March 15:  
  * Finish project  


### ASSIGNMENT
> “There is no way to think up an original and extraordinary design — it can only come as a result of pursuing a given task. In the same way running down a list of words is different from making a narrative.” – [Artemy Lebedev](https://www.artlebedev.com/mandership/162)    

This project is the first of two assignments that dig deep into complex social and political issues. Climate change has gone from a [fragmented set of ideas in the 1800s](https://history.aip.org/climate/timeline.htm) to a [hotly-contested scientific theory](https://theconversation.com/30-years-ago-global-warming-became-front-page-news-and-both-republicans-and-democrats-took-it-seriously-97658) in the 20th century and now is considered an [agreed-upon fact by more than 97% of actively publishing climate scientists](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus). The goal of this assignment is not to prove climate change is real, nor is it to try to show all the evidence or impacts a warming Earth will have: that would be an impossible task! Instead, in this project you will do exploratory research, find interesting time-based data, and create a refined visualization using `chart.js` that tells part of the complex story of climate change.

Your project will have a few key components:  
* Use [time-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data related to climate change (see also [*What About Maps?*](#what-about-maps) below)  
* A single visualization made with `chart.js` that you have refined  
* A published dataset with citation to the original source(s)

### DELIVERABLES

### FOR MONDAY, MARCH 1  
To kick off the project, this week you should do three things:

**Read `asdf`**  

**Find data to work with**  

**Identify a story (or stories) you want to tell**  



### FOR MONDAY, MARCH 8  
Coming soon!


### FOR MONDAY, MARCH 15  
Coming soon!

### WHAT ABOUT MAPS?  
When thinking about climate change, maps immediately come to mind. They allow us to see changes in temperature over time, location of unprecedented weather events, and impacts of sea-level rise in a spatial format that is familiar. So why aren't we making maps for this project?

The reason is two-fold. First, maps can be deeply complex to make: their data is often in a [weird format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) and choices in how a map is displayed are [not just technical but political](https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/ethics_online/politics-and-cartography-the-power-of-deception-through-distortion). (For a fun example, see the amazing project [*The True Size Of*](https://thetruesize.com).) Jumping into maps only a few weeks into the semester would be really challenging.

This brings us to the other reason. Time-series data is readily available and does a great job of showing a key idea in understanding this topic: that the global climate has changed! Time-series data also comes in a much easier format to work with, which allows you to incrementally add new technologies to your projects and focus more on making something that tells a story visually.

We'll definitely be looking at a lot of maps this semester. They are some of the earliest forms of data visualization, plus maps can be just stunning to look at! If you want more maps in your life, it could be something to consider for your final project. Or take *Visualizing Society* with Prof. Alex Wellerstein here at Stevens for lots of maps!
