What happens when you correlate income data with areas prone to the effects of climate change?  What do 100 years of weather look like?  This course is designed to introduce methodologies and tools for looking at data and using the tools of design to turn it into useful and interesting visual representations. Data visualization is different from statistics, data science, or even simply understanding scientific data: we’re not so interested in proving things as we are in mining stories to tell within data and finding appropriate, exciting ways of communicating them. Throughout the semester, we’ll be doing data *visualization*, not *data* visualization.

>"90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years." – IBM report on big data

>"Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space." – Edward Tufte

>"Getting information from a table is like extracting sunlight from a cucumber." – Arthur and Henry Farquhar, 1981

This semester will begin by considering data with only analog technology: pencil and paper. From there, we’ll use Adobe Illustrator for developing print graphics, along with more complex but readily available tools like Microsoft Excel for manipulating data. Towards the middle of the semester, we’ll look at writing simple programs in Python to load, clean, and extract information from large data sets. This class assumes you’ve never used any of these tools before, but if you have it will allow you to make more complex, exciting projects.

You will create several shorter projects followed by the development of a large final project of your own devising. While much of our work will be print-based, you will be welcome to consider non-traditional output formats such as videos, websites, installations, sculpture, and sonification, too. Along the way, we’ll also talk about the influence of data on our daily life and society, look at examples of artists and designers working with data in interesting ways, dig for data online (the data equivalent of dumpster diving), and make lots of stuff.
