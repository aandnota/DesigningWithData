What does a day of flight paths in the US look like? What can we learn about NYC by mapping shadows? How can a Twitter bot help us experience the minute details found in census data? How can data, design, and journalism pair to show racial injustice in America? Data visualization is a complex and varied field, found in a range of disciplines where the methodology ranges from scientific (full of stats and academic papers) to infographics found in newspapers and even fine art that uses data as an input. Our focus this semester will be seeing data as a complicated political and technical material charged with aesthetic potential. We'll explore this idea through creative projects that will ask you to think about how we record and represent the world through data, how we can tell stories with information, and to connect this research and creative work with ideas and issues you are excited and passionate about.

>"90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years." – IBM report on big data

>"Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space." – Edward Tufte

>"Getting information from a table is like extracting sunlight from a cucumber." – Arthur and Henry Farquhar, 1981

We'll begin by considering what can constitute data and analog ways of presenting it. From there, we'll use Adobe Illustrator for developing print graphics, along with more complex but readily-available tools like Microsoft Excel for manipulating data. In the second half of the semester, we'll work with Processing, a coding platform that will allow us to parse and visualize massive datasets. This class assumes you’ve never used any of these tools before, but if you have your experience will allow you to make more complex, exciting projects.
