What does a day of flight paths in the US look like? What can we learn about NYC by mapping shadows? How can a Twitter bot help us experience the minute details found in census data? Data visualization is a complex and varied field, found in a range of disciplines where the methodology ranges from scientific (full of stats and academic papers) to infographics found in newspapers and even fine art that uses data as an input. This semester, we will be exploring through creative research projects the design challenges that data presents, think about how to tell stories with data, and how we record and represent the world through data.

>"90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years." – IBM report on big data

>"Getting information from a table is like extracting sunlight from a cucumber." – Arthur and Henry Farquhar

We'll begin by considering a broad idea of what data might be and analog ways of presenting it, starting with a single number and then thinking about creative ways to show really huge numbers. From there, we'll start using Javascript (a programming language the web) and a library called `chart.js` which allows us to quickly load and tweak visualizations. Our projects will involve lots of research, finding our own data, and will be framed around contemporary issues: climate change and race in America. We'll also look at ways to clean, parse, and publish our own datasets. The last third of the semester will be spent on a large-scale, open-ended visualization project of your choosing. Along the way, we'll also take a look at lots of visualizations throughout the last thousand years, read about best practices for artists and designers working with data, and see the varied career paths that designers interested in data can take.

This class assumes you’ve never worked with data or written code before. If you have, you'll be encouraged to push your work and make more complex projects. Students are encouraged to combine what we do with any additional software, materials, and processes that you're familiar with and/or excited about.
