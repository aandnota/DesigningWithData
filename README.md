What does a day of flight paths in the US look like? What can we learn about NYC by mapping shadows? How can a Twitter bot help us experience the minute details found in census data? How can data, design, and journalism pair to show racial injustice in America? Data visualization is a complex and varied field, found in a range of disciplines where the methodology ranges from scientific (full of stats and academic papers) to infographics found in newspapers and even fine art that uses data as an input. Our focus this semester will be seeing data as a complicated political and technical material charged with aesthetic potential. We'll explore this idea through creative projects that will ask you to think about how we record and represent the world through data, how we can tell stories with information, and to connect this research and creative work with ideas and issues you are excited and passionate about.

>"90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years." – IBM report on big data

>"Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space." – Edward Tufte

>"Getting information from a table is like extracting sunlight from a cucumber." – Arthur and Henry Farquhar

We'll begin by considering what can constitute data and analog ways of presenting it, starting with a single number and then thinking about creative ways to show really huge numbers. From there, we'll start using Javascript (a programming language the web) and a library called `chart.js` which allows us to quickly load and tweak visualizations. Our projects will involve lots of research, finding our own data, and will be framed around contemporary issues: climate change, the COVID pandemic, and race in America. We'll also look at ways to clean, parse, and publish our own datasets. The last third of the semester will be spent on a large-scale, open-ended visualization project of your choosing. Along the way, we'll also take a look at lots of visualizations throughout the last 300 years and read about best practices for artists and designers working with data.

This class assumes you’ve never worked with data or written code before. If you have, you'll be encourage to push your work and make more complex projects. Students are encouraged to use any additional software, materials, and processes that you're familiar with.
