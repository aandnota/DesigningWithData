### Watch tutorial videos  
This week, we have some tutorials on how to customize your chart's tooltips, how to create more than one visualization on a page, and an introduction to adding text, images, and other elements to your project's page too.

### Prototype your visualizations  
Your main work this week will be prototyping the three visualizations that you'll include in your project. These don't need to be perfect yet: instead, focus on getting the data loaded (and tidied up, if necessary) and that the visualizations clearly communicate the information.

"Storytelling" is a key idea here: you don't have to do everything in a single visualization, so how do you lead us through the story you're trying to tell? What is important for us to see first: the whole dataset, an important part?

If you have time, you can also start adding additional elements to your page such as text and images.

### Watch *The Design of Nothing*  
Please also watch Andy Kirk's amazing talk [*The Design of Nothing: Null, Zero, Blank*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqzAuqNPYVM). It's just over 20 minutes long but is packed with amazing examples for how to think about and deal with missing data.
