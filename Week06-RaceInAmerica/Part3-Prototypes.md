# PART 3: PROTOTYPES  

### TLDR  
* ⚠️ Due Monday, April 5 by 11am EST ⚠️  
* [Watch tutorial videos](#watch-tutorial-videos)  
* [Prototype your visualizations](#prototype-your-visualizations)  
* [Watch *The Design of Nothing* by Andy Kirk](#watch-the-design-of-nothing)  
* Nothing to turn in this week, just bring your WIP to class for feedback  

***

### Watch tutorial videos  
This week, we have some tutorials on how to customize your chart's tooltips, how to create more than one visualization on a page, and an introduction to adding text, images, and other elements to your project's page too.

* [Video tutorials for this week](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsGCUnpinsDkzLls8TCm0BtDUMfH2poqU)

You can also find the `json`, `kml`, and other data files shown in the `Demos` folder here.

### Prototype your visualizations  
Your main work this week will be prototyping the three visualizations that you'll include in your project. These don't need to be perfect yet: instead, focus on getting the data loaded (and tidied up, if necessary) and that the visualizations clearly communicate the information.

"Storytelling" is a key idea here: you don't have to do everything in a single visualization, so how do you lead us through the story you're trying to tell? What is important for us to see first: the whole dataset, an important part?

Another useful way to frame this work is using *Seven Stages of Creating a Data Visualization* by Ben Fry (co-creator of the Processing language and head of [Fathom Information Design](https://fathom.info)):  

* **Acquire:** Formulate a question, find your sources and gather data  
* **Parse:** What's in the data? What ideas does the data suggest?  
* **Filter:** Determine which data-points/correlations are most interesting, remove "noise" from dataset  
* **Mine:** Extract data for your visualization, double-check results  
* **Represent:** Correlate data into meaningful forms, create initial representations of data in visual form  
* **Refine:** Evaluate the results of early representations, iteratively refine the representation and question  
* **Interact:** View the results, look for interesting stories, add value or meaning through additions/features  

If you have time, you can also start adding additional elements to your page such as text and images.

### Watch *The Design of Nothing*  
Please also watch Andy Kirk's amazing talk [*The Design of Nothing: Null, Zero, Blank*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqzAuqNPYVM). It's just over 20 minutes long but is packed with amazing examples for how to think about and deal with missing data.
