0. grab your data

https://www.nj.com/education/2018/03/heres_how_every_nj_high_school_fared_on_the_sat.html#incart_2box_nj-homepage-featured

  - open in excel
  - copy > paste into sheets
  - (or import right to sheets)

2. column width
  - select column headers
  - right click
  - resize > fit to data...

3. headers
  - note: headers and data messy
  - mix of all caps
  - rename to make clearer
  - could bold too

  - get rid of some columns too

4. school and district names
  - some all caps, some not
  - make em all caps
  - select column > insert right
  - =UPPER()
  - run auto-fill as suggested!

  then...
  - copy column
  - select orig col
  - edit > paste special > values...
  - delete formula col

5. explore data
  - data > create filter
  - sort by various cols

6. ask a question:
  - what's the average score?

  - random cell...
    - =AVERAGE([col])
    - do for total, math, and reading
    - number format

  - compare w SIT
    - reading: 640–710
    - math: 700–780
    - =(low+high) / 2

7. ask another question:
  - how does each school compare with
    the national average?

https://reports.collegeboard.org/archive/sat-suite-program-results/2019/class-2019-results

  - nation-wide mean scores are...
    - reading/writing: 531
    - math: 528
    - total: 1059

  - add in col next to total
  - select cell...
  - double-click little box to copy down

  - new column
  - =[state mean] - [us mean]
  - divergence from us mean
  - + means higher, - means lower

  - data > turn off filter
  - do it again, sort by divergence

8. and another question
  - how many schools are better at
    reading than math?

  - new column > "better at reading"
  - =IF([reading] > [math], "YES", "NO")
  - paste down

  - how many for each?
  - in random cell...
    - =COUNTIF([range], "YES")
    - same for no
  - % of all nj schools...
    - 399 schools
    - =([count] / 399)
    - will be 0–1
    - format to %

9. how much aid does each district get?

https://www.nj.gov/education/stateaid/1617/

  - total aid given
    - new cell
    - =SUM('Aid by County'!C:C)
    - format as $

  - super fancy: aid by district
    - new column...
    - =INDEX('Aid by County'!C:C, MATCH(C2, 'Aid by County'!B:B, 0))
    - paste down

  - what is that formula?!
    - gives us the value from the aid sheet
    - compares with all district names
    - 0 = first match only
    - note some #N/A values!
      - means dist wasn't found...
      - possibly spelled wrong
      - or charter schools that don't get state aid
      - or missing data
