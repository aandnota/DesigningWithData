# INFOGRAPHICS: RACE IN AMERICA

### TLDR  
* Create at least three visualizations investigating the topic of race in America  
* Include contextual information, images, etc  
* [For March 22](Part1-ContextualizationResearch.md): contextualization research, find data  
* For March 29: narrow topic, further research, sketches  
* For April 5: prototypes, watch *The Design of Nothing: Null, Zero, Blank*  
* For April 12: finish project, start thinking about `Final Project` ideas  

⚠️ Since this is a multi-week project, details for each week are in separate files! Links in the `TLDR` section above ⚠️

### ASSIGNMENT
> “71% of African Americans live in counties that are in violation of federal air pollution standards” – [American Public Health Association](https://www.apha.org/-/media/files/pdf/topics/climate/guide_appendix.ashx), via [@Leahtommi](https://twitter.com/Leahtommi/status/1366153792773787649)  

> “Ours is not the struggle of one day, one week, or one year... Ours is the struggle of a lifetime, or maybe even many lifetimes, and each one of us in every generation must do our part.” – John Lewis

For our last directed assignment, we'll investigate another important, wide-ranging issue: race in America. We'll dig deeper into contextual research, find data to explore, and create a multi-part visualization that tells a small part of this complex story. The potential approaches here are vast: current issues like the disproportionate killing of Black people by the police and ensuing protests over the past few years; historical movements for racial justice; Jim Crow laws and other discriminatory policies; the uneven impact of climate change on communinities of color; borders and immigration law... this barely scratches the surface. [Intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) expands this even further, showing us the myriad ways that race connects with other aspects of identity like gender, class, sexuality, and disability.

Data visualization has played an important role when discussing race in America. [Ida B. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_B._Wells), born enslaved in 1862, began a national anti-lynching campaign when mobs lynched three of her friends and destroyed her press. [Her book *A Red Record*](https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/exhibitions/artifact/red-record-tabulated-statistics-and-alleged-causes-lynchings-united-states) was the first to collect nation-wide data about lynching. In the late 1800s, [W.E.B. Du Bois created over 60 hand-drawn visualizations](https://hyperallergic.com/306559/w-e-b-du-boiss-modernist-data-visualizations-of-black-life) showing topics ranging from the routes of slave trade to Georgia, the number of Black students in different school courses, and the value of Black-owned property. Of course, visualization hasn't always played a positive role. For hundreds of years, we have redrawn maps to move Native people from their land and gerrymandered voting districts to suppress minority voting. Data visualization also helps us see where data isn't recorded: for example, police departments in the US aren't required to report fatal police shootings, making it tremendously difficult to understand the scope of the problem (though some [amazing efforts have been made to do so](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database)).

We'll start with contextual research: reading and researching possible topics, as well as finding data that can be sources for stories to tell. This research thread will continue as we create prototypes, refine them, and create a finished project. We'll also look at how to create multiple visualizations in the same page and how we can include media like text and images to weave everything together.

Your project will have a few key components:  
* Use any kind of data, visualized with `chart.js` and, optionally, Adobe Illustrator  
* Include at least three separate visualizations as well as text, quotes, images, video, etc that weave a story about your topic  
* A published dataset with citation to the original source(s)

### A NOTE  
For many Americans, racism and the accompanying issues of discrimination, uneven laws and their enforcement, police violence, and other harms are a daily reality. For others, the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Michael Brown, and many, many others sparked a new or renewed call for racial justice. When we talk about "race in America," this doesn't necessarily mean racism, though the two are intertwined more often then not. And, while it's an important focus at the moment, we don't just mean Black Americans but all [people of color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color). It is also worth noting that [race is a human construction](https://www.vox.com/2014/10/10/6943461/race-social-construct-origins-census) and has no basis in biology but that doesn't prevent it from being a very real force in our society.

As we work on this project, you may find these conversations difficult, but that's what makes it important. Over the next four weeks, I ask you to be honest, to listen to each other and your research, and to give yourself mental space to process, try to understand, and re-present the data and stories you find.

If at any point in our conversations you need to take a beat or mute our Zoom conversation, please do so. And, if you have suggestions for making this conversation or assignment better, don't hesitate to send me a note or speak up during class.
