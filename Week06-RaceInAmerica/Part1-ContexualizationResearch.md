### Contextual Readings  
This week, the main work to be done is to situate ourselves in the topic of race in America. We each come to this with different experiences, contexts, and gaps in our understanding. It is impossible to encapsulate this entire topic in just a few readings and the goal here is not to become experts in the topic, but instead to swim in stories and experiences that can inform and direct our work.

Like many aspects of this this project, these readings can be emotionally draining but they deserve our full attention. Before you start, take a moment: put away your phone, close other applications, turn off the music, and try to deeply listen to what the authors are saying.

* [*Historical Foundations of Race*](https://nmaahc.si.edu/learn/talking-about-race/topics/historical-foundations-race) by [David R. Roediger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Roediger) (no need to watch the embedded videos, though they are amazing too)  
* [*Letter to My Son*](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/tanehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me/397619) by [Ta Nehisi Coates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta-Nehisi_Coates)  

As you read, ask yourself the question "what do I not know much about and want to understand better?" These questions are incredibly fruitful starting points for your research. We'll discuss these two readings next week in class, so please come ready to talk about them and your research.

### Optional Readings  
If you have time, here are some additional readings (and other media) that will add more context to this project. If you find others that resonate with you, please let me know and I'll add them here!

* [James Baldwin debating William F. Buckley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tek9h3a5wQ) in 1965 on the question "Has the American Dream been achieved at the expense of the American Negro?" (this video, an hour long, is truly remarkable as an encapsulation of the time, Baldwin's amazing rhetoric, and the saddening resonances with today)  
* [*The Invention of the Police*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/07/20/the-invention-of-the-police) by Jill Lepore (a fascinating read on the long, troubling history of policing in the US)  
* James Baldwin's [*A Letter to My Nephew*](https://progressive.org/magazine/letter-nephew), which is the inspiration for the Ta Nehisi Coates piece above\*  
* John Lewis' [*Together You Can Redeem the Soul of Our Nation*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/john-lewis-civil-rights-america.html) in the New York Times\*  
* [Amanda Gorman reading *The Hill We Climb*](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/amanda-gorman-inaugural-poem-transcript/index.html) at the Biden/Harris inauguration\*  
* [*The U.S. Has a Long-Standing History of Vilifying Minority Groups During Times of Crisis*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-has-led-to-an-uptick-in-anti-asian-racism) by Alex Samuels  
* [*Lynch Mobs Killed Latinos Across the West. The Fight to Remember These Atrocities is Just Starting*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/us/porvenir-massacre-texas-mexicans.html) by Simon Romero/NYT

### Find a research rabbit hole  
From your reading notes, identify a few of your "things I want to know more about" questions that are particularly interesting and spend some time online researching them. It may be helpful to connect this with your personal experience, with a historical period or event, or a specific community. This isn't about coming to a definitive answer but instead about following rabbit holes: research that leads you from a known starting point down meandering pathways to topics you never expected. Follow links in articles, look for citations, open *lots* of tabs!

This kind of research should be open-ended and not results oriented. You don't need to walk away from this with a clear plan but, kind of like our readings, a sense of part of this topic and new things you didn't know about before.

Take lots of notes, keep track of images and (if you find some) data.
