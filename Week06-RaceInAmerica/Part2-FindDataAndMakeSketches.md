### Watch tutorial videos  
This week, please check out these tutorials on using Google Sheets and other visualization formats with `chart.js`:

* [Video tutorials for this week](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsGCUnpinsDnRq3Bj8tv0RXj8lTjD2iNt)  
* [Code examples](https://editor.p5js.org/jeffThompson/collections/JCZu66jDK)  
* Spreadsheets from the Sheets tutorial:  
  * [Unprocessed data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iW431-iGAFGhl_ozA3xYnDDQB7ioywTeWgmIrG_ngGM/edit#gid=0) (for you to practice with)  
  * [...and the same data, all cleaned up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iW431-iGAFGhl_ozA3xYnDDQB7ioywTeWgmIrG_ngGM/edit#gid=0)  

The Sheets video is a bit longer than usual so feel free to stop after the first half, which shows you basics for manipulating data and some common formulas. Next week, we'll have some demos on adding images, etc to our pages as well as some additional features of `chart.js`.

### Narrow your topic  
Last week, you spent time following research rabbit holes, hopefully ending up somewhere unexpected and interesting. This week, you should think about what you found and narrow your topic. You'll want to end up with something broad enough that you have room to explore and change direction but specific enough so you can get started.

Some ways to think about this that might be helpful:  
* Look at the "what do I want to know more about" questions you came up with  
* Is there a specific story, person, or experience you can focus on?  
* If you found historical topics, is there a connection you can draw between that time and today? Something that has changed over time (or hasn't)?  
* Pick a decade and view your topic through that lens  

Write up a one-sentence pitch for your project: what will you be looking at and what's a key takeaway. Keep it tight, declarative, and specific! Imagine you're pitching this to an editor or client.

### Find data  
With a more refined focus for your project, your main work this week will be finding data to work with. While `csv` data will still be most common and easy to work with, `json` data will also be possible (we'll take a look at how to work with data in this format next week). If you find data in another format, feel free to reach out and we can talk about whether you'll be able to use it!

For this project, you'll be making three separate visualizations. A single dataset might be interesting enough on its own (or can be broken up into sub-datasets) but you might also want to find complementary data too.

If you want, try putting your data into `chart.js` (or do a quick-and-dirty visualization with Sheets/Excel) and see how it looks. As before, keep careful track of your sources for publishing your data at the end.

### Wireframe sketches  
This project expands from a single visualization into a rich, multi-part project that includes visualizations as well as text, quotes, images, video, etc. In order to start planning what that will look like and what you want to include, this week you should make at least two [wireframe sketches](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe) of your project.

A wireframe is a simple, schematic view used to figure out how screen-based projects will look. The focus here is on structure and flow – this is called a "low-fidelity" wireframe (as opposed to super fancy, detailed renderings that look like real websites). There are specialized tools to make wireframes, or you can use Illustrator, but for our purposes hand-drawn is totally ok. [This page has some great examples](https://designmodo.com/web-mobile-wireframe-sketches) to get you started.

The real work here is in thinking about layout and flow, so your drawings don't have to be masterpieces. This kind of ["paper prototyping"](https://uxplanet.org/the-magic-of-paper-prototyping-51693eac6bc3) is great because you won't mind making big changes! That said, try to make them as readable as possible for other folks so they can give you feedback.

Make at least two drawings (digitally or by hand) that show the overall structure of your page. Where does the title of your project go? Where are your visualizations within the page? What do we see first (["above the fold,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_fold) in old-fashioned newspaper speak)?

### Turning everything in  
When finished, please:  

* Upload photos of your wireframe drawings to Canvas  
* Include your one-sentence project description as a comment
