### ASSIGNMENT
This week, we'll start thinking about the ways that we can visually encode numbers. There are lots of premade formats, some familiar ([pie charts](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/pie-chart), [line graphs](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/line-chart)) and some less so ([radar diagrams](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/radar-diagram), [violin plots](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/violin-plot)). But while very useful for distilling lots of numbers into a meaningful whole, these formats can lack creativity and visual impact when trying to show just a few numbers.

Over the past few years, there has been a lot of discussion around wealth in America. Jeff Bezos' net worth ([$187 billion](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/10/944620768/theres-rich-and-theres-jeff-bezos-rich-meet-the-members-of-the-100-billion-club)) versus the wage paid to Amazon warehouse workers ([about $15/hour](https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Amazon-Warehouse-Worker-Hourly-Pay-E6036_D_KO7,23.htm)).  During the Covid pandemic, the world's richest people became [$931 billion wealthier](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/12/01/american-billionaires-that-got-richer-during-covid/43205617). Elon Musk's wealth grew an astonishing [524% between March and December 2020](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-rich-got-richer-during-covid-19-heres-how-american-billionaires-performed), a $129 billion increase. But there's a point where these numbers just get too big for us to really understand.

Your assignment is to create a visualization, using any media and format you like, to show the relative difference between one dollar, a million dollars, and a billion dollars.

A good place to start is think about converting a dollar to another object. For example, in [Tom Scott's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YUWDrLazCg) he converts the thickness of a dollar bill into distance:

* One dollar bill is about is \~0.1mm thick
* One million bills stacked up would be about the length of a football field
* One billion bills would be about 67.7 miles

Then think about how you can show (or have us hear, or otherwise make us understand) that difference. In the video, Scott literally goes the distance to make this real for us: he first walks the length of a football field, then gets in his car and drives for over an hour from his home to the ocean. The video goes on and on, no narration just a view out the windshield, but it's that boring duration that makes it so impactful. A simple idea that's really effective.

You can use illustrations, video, photography, collage, music... anything that best shows the vast differences that a few zeroes can make.


### DELIVERABLES
* Visualization (in any media/format) that shows the difference between $1, $1M, and $1B
* Upload finished piece (or URL, if it's too big or is better that way) to Canvas
* Include 1-paragraph description of your approach to the project as a comment


### INSPIRATION
*Some of these examples are in the `Images` folder for this week, others are links*
* Three versions of the same visualization showing the relative height of a Coast Redwood compared to the Statue of Liberty, Big Ben, the Space Shuttle, and other trees
* Charles and Ray Eames amazing (and entirely analog) film [*Powers of Ten*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0) from 1977
* Tom Scott's [*A Million Dollars vs a Billion Dollars, Visualized: A Road Trip*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YUWDrLazCg) which inspired this project
* Humphrey Yang's [*Elon Musk's $195 Net Worth Visualized with Rice*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3oQF9F0aO8), which in turn inspired Tom Scott's video
* An uncredited `gif` showing different causes of death (spoiler: sharks = 5, deer = 130, and snakes = 100,000)
* Josh Orter's (of the amazingly-named but sadly-defunct [Stupid Calculations](http://www.stupidcalculations.com) blog) [*Every iPhone Screen*](http://www.stupidcalculations.com/blog/2013/5/14/stupid-calculation-no-1-monophone)
* [*1/10,000th Scale World*](https://xkcd.com/2411/) by xkcd, featuring giant people walking around the Earth
* A screenshot of a tweet from Paul Franz that converts 1M and 1B into time
* An old but excellent video from Veritasium titled [*How Far Away is the Moon? (The Scale of the Universe)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz9D6xba9Og)


### RESOURCES
* If you need to convert one unit to another, you can just type it into Google (or, if you're on a Mac, into Spotlight!). For example, if you search for `0.55mm to inches` it will give you the answer â€“ easy!
