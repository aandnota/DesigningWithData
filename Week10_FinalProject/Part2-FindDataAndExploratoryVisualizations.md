# PART 2: FIND DATA, EXPLORATORY VISUALIZATIONS

### TLDR  
* ⚠️ Due Monday, April 26 by 11am EST ⚠️  
* [Find data for your topic](#find-data-for-your-topic)  
* [One or two exploratory visualizations](#exploratory-visualizations)  
* [Turning everything in](#turning-everything-in)

### FIND DATA FOR YOUR TOPIC  
With a sense of your project's topic and approach, your main task this week is to find data to work with. Be sure to keep track of the data's source so you can cite it later.

A few other tips:  
* On Google, if you include `filetype:csv` or `filetype:xlsx`, the search will only return files with those extensions! For example, if I wanted data about whale population, I would search for: `whale population filetype:csv`  
* Before creating any visualizations, try exploring the data in Excel/Sheets: sorting by different values, doing some averaging or other calculations, etc  

If necessary, do some cleanup of the data so you can feed it into `chart.js`.

### EXPLORATORY VISUALIZATIONS  
With some data in hand, the next step is to create 1–2 quick visualizations from it. Don't worry about styling or making it look pretty: this is just about seeing the data so you know what's there, what's interesting, and what format for presentation might make the most sense.

You can definitely use `chart.js` for this (grab one of the examples as a starting point even) but Excel/Sheets is also an option.

### TURNING EVERYTHING IN  
When done, please take a screenshot of your exploratory visualization(s) and upload to Canvas. No need to turn in anything for your data sources.
