### FINISH YOUR PROJECT  
For the final exam period (listed above) please finish your project for our critique. Think about how you can very briefly explain your project to us and what specific feedback you might want from us.

In order to make the crit run as smoothly as possible, I'll ask you to either:  
* Share your screen to show us your project  
* Send a link in the chat and I can share my screen  

Please come to the critique caffinated and ready to share your work!

### TURNING EVERYTHING IN  
Since everyone's projects vary in format, please use one of the following options to turn in your work on Canvas:  

* Code-based projects: submit a link to your project in the `p5.js` web editor or hosted elsewhere online  
* Video/animation: submit a link to your piece on YouTube, Vimeo, etc  
* Print/screen: upload your project to Canvas (PDF is preferred)  
* Other formats: chat with me about what's the best way to turn in your project!
