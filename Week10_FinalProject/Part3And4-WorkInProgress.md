# PART 3/4: WORK IN PROGRESS

### TLDR  
* ⚠️ For May 3rd and 10th ⚠️  
* [Work on your project over the next two weeks](#work-in-progress)  
* [We'll have additional demos as requested!](#additional-demos)  
* No need to turn anything in to Canvas  

***

### WORK IN PROGRESS  
Over the next two weeks, we'll continue to look at your `Race in America` projects and have open work/help time. There are no specific deliverables and no need to turn in anything to Canvas, but you should be working each week on your project. (Especially because our exam period is scheduled just two days after our last regular class meeting.)

Think about what's required for a minimum version of your project (in programming, we often create what's called a *minimum viable product* document, or MVP – [more on that here](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming2/blob/master/Week08_Simulation/Part1-ResearchAndMVPDocument.md#create-an-mvp-document)). Prioritize the stuff that needs to happen for your project to be completed, even if those steps aren't the most fun. You can always add cool additions and features later!

Since our synchronous class time will mostly be used for critiques, be sure to make use of the drop-in hours if you want help, feedback on your work, etc. (I'm just hanging out on Zoom – come on by!)

### ADDITIONAL DEMOS  
We won't have any more demos in the next two weeks, since you'll be working hard on your final projects. But if there's something you'd like to learn more about – a tool or process or workflow or a "how did they make that?" – please let me know! We can spend some time during class covering those topics.
